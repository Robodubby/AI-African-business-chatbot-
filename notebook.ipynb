    "# AI-Powered Chatbot for Local Businesses: Project Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Understanding\n",
    "Small businesses in Africa often struggle to answer customer questions quickly and consistently. Many don’t have dedicated customer service teams, so an AI chatbot can help by providing instant answers to common questions, making customer service more reliable and freeing up staff.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal of the Chatbot\n",
    "Build a simple AI chatbot that helps local businesses answer frequently asked customer questions, using a small dataset and simple techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Summary\n",
    "- **Main Question:** Typical customer question\n",
    "- **Alternative Ways to Ask:** Other ways to phrase the same question\n",
    "- **Simplified Phrasings:** Even simpler versions\n",
    "- **Simplified Response:** The answer the chatbot should give\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "We use a rule-based chatbot with basic NLP: lowercasing, cleaning punctuation, and fuzzy matching (SequenceMatcher). This keeps things simple and works well for small datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Pipeline Steps\n",
    "1. Load the data\n",
    "2. Inspect the data\n",
    "3. Build a dictionary of question patterns to responses\n",
    "4. Clean text for matching\n",
    "5. Use fuzzy matching to find the closest question\n",
    "6. Evaluate chatbot accuracy\n",
    "7. Simulate training with train-test split\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Chunk Explanations\n",
    "- **Chunk 1:** Load the dataset and preview the first few rows.\n",
    "- **Chunk 2:** Build a dictionary mapping all question phrasings to their answers.\n",
    "- **Chunk 3:** Define a function to get a response, using exact and fuzzy matching.\n",
    "- **Chunk 4:** Clean up text by lowercasing and removing punctuation.\n",
    "- **Chunk 5:** Use SequenceMatcher for fuzzy matching.\n",
    "- **Chunk 6:** Create a DataFrame from the dictionary for splitting.\n",
    "- **Chunk 7:** Backup the dictionary for restoration.\n",
    "- **Chunk 8:** Define an ask function and show example interactions.\n",
    "- **Chunk 9:** Split data into training and test sets (80/20) to simulate training.\n",
    "- **Chunk 10:** Build a training dictionary and define a matcher using only training data.\n",
    "- **Chunk 11:** Evaluate chatbot accuracy and print the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Rule-Based and NLP Techniques Are Used\n",
    "This project uses a rule-based approach, meaning the chatbot matches user questions to answers using a dictionary of known patterns. To make matching smarter, we use simple NLP techniques:\n",
    "- Lowercasing: All questions and patterns are converted to lowercase so \"Password\" and \"password\" are treated the same.\n",
    "- Punctuation Cleaning: We remove punctuation to avoid mismatches caused by extra symbols.\n",
    "- Fuzzy Matching: If a user's question isn't an exact match, we use SequenceMatcher to find the closest known question.\n",
    "These steps help the chatbot understand different ways customers might ask the same thing, even if the wording is slightly different.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training Simulation\n",
    "We split the data into training (80%) and test (20%) sets. The chatbot is trained on the training set and tested on the test set to see how well it answers new questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accuracy Calculation\n",
    "Accuracy is the percentage of test questions answered correctly. For example, 75% accuracy means the chatbot got 3 out of 4 questions right.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges & Limitations\n",
    "- Limited data and local language support\n",
    "- Rule-based system can’t generalize or handle new phrasings\n",
    "- No context awareness\n",
    "\n",
    "## Possible Improvements\n",
    "- Collect more data, especially in local languages\n",
    "- Use more advanced NLP models\n",
    "- Add context handling and user feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Summary\n",
    "This project shows how a simple AI chatbot can help local businesses answer customer questions quickly and consistently. With basic NLP and a rule-based approach, we achieved good accuracy and set the stage for future improvements."
